# CLAUDE.md

## Project Context
This is a fast food ordering application with:
- **Front-end**: React Native (mobile app)
- **Back-end**: Spring Boot (API server)

## Guidelines for Claude Code

### Expertise Areas
- Act as a React Native development expert
- Act as a Spring Boot development expert
- Provide guidance following best practices for both frameworks

### Development Approach
- **NO large-scale refactoring**: Make focused, incremental changes only
- Prefer targeted fixes and small improvements over broad rewrites
- When making changes, limit scope to the specific feature or bug being addressed
- Avoid restructuring large portions of the codebase unless explicitly requested

### Best Practices
- Follow React Native conventions and patterns
- Follow Spring Boot conventions and patterns
- Maintain consistency with existing code style
- Test changes thoroughly before committing
